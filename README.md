## The Vision

MultiBit Exchange is an exchange platform that can be leveraged as a starting point for creating an exchange of any
kind.

## What is it?

MultiBit Exchange is a platform that consists of a REST API front-end and trading engine back-end that
can be leveraged to manage exchanges, securities, accounts, orders, and trades. It also aims to be very well tested and
clean making it easy to extend to support additional order types and matching algorithms.

## What can I do with it?

There is an endless variety of types of exchanges that can be created using MultiBit Exchange. Here are a few ideas:
* An exchange company such as Mt.Gox for trading various fiat currencies for BTC
* An exchange centered around BTC with multiple securities for exchanging BTC for cell phone minutes, gift cards, gold, etc.
* A precious metal exchange: gold, silver, platinum, etc.
* A traditional currency exchange
* A test platform for experimenting with HFT algorithms, experimental order types, algorithmic trading, etc.
* An Inter-exchange arbitrage platform

## What are the major characteristics of MultiBit Exchange?

MultiBit Exchange aims to be more that just a functioning exchange, but a well crafted codebase that is:
* Well tested
* Well structured
* High-throughput / Low-latency by leveraging event sourcing and the [LMAX Disruptor pattern](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html).
* Extensible (not necessarily configurable or pluggable, but definitely malleable)

## What development methodology is used?

> "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."
> Michael Feathers

Great software doesn't just happen. It requires a disciplined approach. The following methodology is
used to develop MultiBit Exchange:

* Focus on the core domain and application of Domain Driven Design principles
* Application of Test Driven Development
* Disciplined development of well-structured layered code
* Leveraging proven existing technology wherever possible

## Architecture

MultiBit Exchange follows the hexagonal architecture. See: http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture

## Ultimate goals of MultiBit Exchange

MultiBit Exchange is relatively new, but I have ambitious plans:

* Decentralized - be resistant to shutdown and DDoS attacks.
* Reliable - be able to run with as close to zero downtime as possible.
* Reusable - be simple to understand, leverage, and extend.
* Robust - be thoroughly tested and publicly scrutinized.
* Performant - be able to handle huge volumes with low latency.
* Magical - do all of this without being difficult to leverage.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

Many thanks to all the hard work that was put into the many ideas, libraries, and systems that MultiBit Exchange
is built on:

Domain Driven Design lies at the core of MultiBit Exchange. This is one of the most important contributions
to the software development craft.

## Installing MongoDB

MongoDB is used to support [Read Models](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html).
Follow the usual [MongoDB installation instructions](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/), such as

```
$ brew update
$ brew install mongo
```

Start MongoDB as a background process with

```
$ mongod &
```

Then create the following collections through the Mongo CLI

```
$ mongo
> use mbexchange
```

## Building and running

From the console you can do the following
```
$ cd <project root>
$ mvn clean install
$ java -jar target/web-develop-SNAPSHOT.jar server mbexchange-demo.yml
```

If startup was successful, the first thing you will need to do is create an exchange (a container for securities).
Using a browser plugin like [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en)
POST a JSON document to [localhost:8080/exchanges](http://localhost:8080/exchanges)

Be sure to include the following header
```
Content-type: application/json
```

The format of the JSON document for creating an exchange:
```
{
  "identifier":"myexchange"
}
```

Next, you can navigate to
[localhost:8080/exchanges/myexchange/securities](http://localhost:8080/exchanges/myexchange/securities) to see a list
of securities in your exchange.

To add a security to your exchange
POST a JSON document to [/exchanges/myexchange/securities](http://localhost:8080/exchanges/myexchange/securities)

Again, be sure to include the following header
```
Content-type: application/json
```

The OLD format of the JSON document for creating securities:
```
{
  "tickerSymbol": "TICKER",
  "itemSymbol": "ITM",
  "currencySymbol": "CUR"
}
```


The CURRENT format of the JSON document for creating securities:
```
{
  "ticker": "TICKER",
  "baseCurrency": "BaseCCY",
  "counterCurrency": "CounterCCY"
}
```


Navigate back to [localhost:8080/exchanges/myexchange/securities](http://localhost:8080/exchanges/myexchange/securities) to
see the newly created security.


On Startup, you should see the following options:
```
INFO  [2014-01-12 01:01:45,580] com.yammer.dropwizard.config.Environment:

    POST    /exchanges/{exchangeId}/securities (org.multibit.exchange.infrastructure.adaptor.api.resources.SecuritiesResource)

    POST    /exchanges/{exchangeId}/bids (org.multibit.exchange.infrastructure.adaptor.api.resources.ExchangeResource)

    POST    /tasks/gc (com.yammer.dropwizard.tasks.GarbageCollectionTask)
```


## Which branch?
Use `master` for the latest production release. Use `develop` for the latest release candidate.

If you wish to contribute, please start with `develop`.
