Feature: Core matching logic for market orders

  Scenario: Matching a large Sell market order against multiple limit orders
  The order is large enough to fill the entire opposite book
  The unfilled portion of the market order is cancelled
    When the following orders are submitted:
      | Broker | Side | Qty | Price |
      | A      | Buy  | 100 | 10.7  |
      | B      | Buy  | 200 | 10.6  |
      | C      | Buy  | 300 | 10.5  |
      | D      | Sell | 650 | M     |
    Then the following trades are generated:
      | Buying broker | Selling broker | Qty | Price |
      | A             | D              | 100 | 10.7  |
      | B             | D              | 200 | 10.6  |
      | C             | D              | 300 | 10.5  |
    And market order book looks like:
      | Broker | Qty | Price | Price | Qty | Broker |
      |        |     |       |       |     |        |

  The order is small enough so it fills entirely
